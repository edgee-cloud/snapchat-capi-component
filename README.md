[![Edgee Component Registry](https://img.shields.io/badge/Edgee_Component_Registry-Public-green.svg)](https://www.edgee.cloud/edgee/snapchat-capi)

This component implements the data collection protocol between [Edgee](https://www.edgee.cloud) and [Snapchat CAPI](https://developers.snap.com/api/marketing-api/Conversions-API).

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest component version from our [releases page](../../releases)
2. Place the `snapchat_capi.wasm` file in your server (e.g., `/var/edgee/components`)
3. Add the following configuration to your `edgee.toml`:

```toml
[[components.data_collection]]
id = "snapchat_capi"
file = "/var/edgee/components/snapchat_capi.wasm"
settings.snapchat_access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
settings.snapchat_pixel_id = "YOUR_PIXEL_ID"
settings.snapchat_test_event_code = "TEST_EVENT_CODE" # Optional
```

## Event Handling

### Event Mapping
The component maps Edgee events to Snapchat CAPI events as follows:

| Edgee event | Snapchat CAPI Event  | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Page   | `PageView`     | Triggered when a user views a page |
| Track  | Name of the event | Uses the provided event name directly |
| User   | N/A | Is not provided by the Snapchat CAPI |

### User Event Handling
User events in Snapchat CAPI serve multiple purposes:
- Stores `user_id`, `anonymous_id`, and `properties` on the user's device
- Enriches subsequent Page and Track events with user data
- Enables proper user attribution across sessions

**BE CAREFUL:**
Snapchat Conversions API is designed to create a connection between an advertiserâ€™s marketing data (such as website events) and Snapchat systems that optimize ad targeting, decrease cost per result and measure outcomes.
Each event you send to Snapchat CAPI must have a user property (at least one of the following: `email`, `phone_number`), otherwise the event will be ignored.

Here is an example of a user call:
```javascript
edgee.user({
  user_id: "123",
  properties: {
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  },
});
```

## Configuration Options

### Basic Configuration
```toml
[[components.data_collection]]
id = "snapchat_capi"
file = "/var/edgee/components/snapchat_capi.wasm"
settings.snapchat_access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
settings.snapchat_pixel_id = "YOUR_PIXEL_ID"
settings.snapchat_test_event_code = "TEST_EVENT_CODE" # Optional

# Optional configurations
settings.edgee_default_consent = "pending" # Set default consent status
```

### Event Controls
Control which events are forwarded to Snapchat CAPI:
```toml
settings.edgee_page_event_enabled = true   # Enable/disable page view tracking
settings.edgee_track_event_enabled = true  # Enable/disable custom event tracking
settings.edgee_user_event_enabled = false   # User event is not provided by the snapchat CAPI
```

### Consent Management
Before sending events to Snapchat CAPI, you can set the user consent using the Edgee SDK: 
```javascript
edgee.consent("granted");
```

Or using the Data Layer:
```html
<script id="__EDGEE_DATA_LAYER__" type="application/json">
  {
    "data_collection": {
      "consent": "granted"
    }
  }
</script>
```

If the consent is not set, the component will use the default consent status.
**Important:** Snapchat CAPI requires the consent status to be set to `granted`. If not, the events will be ignored.

| Consent | Events |
|---------|--------|
| pending | ignored |
| denied  | ignored |
| granted | forwarded |
